## What is Jira
Jira is a software application developed by the Australian software company Atlassian that allows teams to track issues, manage projects, and automate workflows.

## Jira Concepts
Jira is based on four key concepts: issues, project, board and workflow.

### Issues
An issue is a single work item you track from creation to completion. An issue could be a bug, a task, a subtask, an epic, a to-do item for an HR team, or an artifact that your documentation team needs to create. People may refer to issues as requests, tickets, or tasks. Itâ€™s better to use issues or the specific issue types that you define to avoid confusion.
